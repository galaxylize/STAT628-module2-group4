My husband had chicken Parmesan and I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. He said his tasted good and my salon was cooked perfect. I also enjoyed whatever the dressing was, I just wish it would have been on the side. For whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side. We agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience. It has a similar feel to Bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience). Our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate. (We asked because of food allergies) She did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! The music also did not match the setting. I really wanted to relax but the music was super up beat and almost had me rushing to leave. We will try again in a few months and I'll update my review then.\",\n",

My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound. \\n\\nThe only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to pickle bills, we had a fantastic evening. Last thing to note, the service was great even though the place was packed!\",\n",

To my surprise it lived up to what others had told me. The ambiance was amazing. Very much like the mission. Candles light up the entire place. The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. They have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine:) This is a great date night spot that I recommend it now to all my friends.\",\n",
